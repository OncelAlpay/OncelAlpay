👋 Hi there!
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a financial professional with a strong interest in Equity Research and Asset Management. While I don’t come from a Computer Science background, I'm excited about using technology and data to explore ideas in investing and portfolio management.

📚 A bit about me:
🎓 Studied Chinese Studies and Enterprise Management
📈 Passed the CFA Level 1 Exam
🧠 Currently learning Python, with a focus on applications in Portfolio Construction

🚀 What I'm doing here:
This GitHub is where I document my learning journey.
My main learning resource is the excellent online course from EDHEC Business School:
Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python.
Alongside the course, I’m using ChatGPT and experimenting on my own to try out ideas, apply concepts, and build a deeper understanding of the tools used in modern finance.

🤖 Tools & Approach:
📘 Primary source: EDHEC's course on portfolio construction with Python
🤝 ChatGPT: A helpful assistant for coding and exploring new concepts
🧪 Self-driven experimentation: Trying things out, making mistakes, and learning by doing
